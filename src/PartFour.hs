module PartFour where

import PartOne

-- Determine whether a given integer number is prime.


-- Determine the greatest common divisor of two positive integer numbers. Use Euclid's algorithm.



-- Determine whether two positive integer numbers are coprime. Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals 1.
  


-- Calculate Euler's totient function phi(m).


-- Determine the prime factors of a given positive integer. Construct a flat list containing the prime factors in ascending order.



-- Determine the prime factors of a given positive integer.



-- Calculate Euler's totient function phi(m) (improved).



-- A list of prime numbers.



-- Goldbach's conjecture.


-- Given a range of integers by its lower and upper limit, print a list of all even numbers and their Goldbach composition.



-- Very rarely, the primes are both bigger than say 50. Try to find out how many such cases there are in the range 2..3000.
